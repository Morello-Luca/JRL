# UR5 Manipulation Project

A simple UR5 robot manipulation controller using mc_rtc.

---

# Project Goal

This project controls a UR5 robot arm using:

- mc_rtc
- C++
- Cartesian control
- a small state machine

The robot:

1. Saves its initial pose
2. Moves to a waypoint
3. Returns to the initial pose
4. Stops in IDLE

---

# Main Idea

The controller moves the robot end-effector (`tool0`) in 3D space.

The motion is controlled through:

- a Posture Task
- an End Effector Task
- a simple State Machine

---

# Project Structure

```text

├── PostureTask

└── State Machine

     ├── WAYPOINT
     ├── GO_HOME
     └── IDLE
```

# End Effector

The end effector is:

```cpp
tool0
```

This is the robot tool/wrist frame.

The controller moves this frame in space.

---

# Coordinate System

The robot moves in:

| Axis | Meaning |
|------|----------|
| X | forward / backward |
| Y | left / right |
| Z | up / down |

Example:

```cpp
Eigen::Vector3d translation(-0.07, 0.05, 0.15);
```

Means:

- X = move backward 7 cm
- Y = move sideways 5 cm
- Z = move upward 15 cm

---

# Controller Functions

The controller has 3 important functions:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| Constructor | Creates tasks |
| reset() | Initializes motion |
| run() | Executes control loop |

---

# Tasks

## PostureTask

Purpose:

- keeps robot stable
- avoids strange joint configurations

---

## EndEffectorTask

Purpose:

- moves `tool0` to a target pose

---

# reset()

Called when the controller starts or resets.

---

## Step 1 — Read Current Pose

```cpp
homePose_ = realRobot().bodyPosW("tool0");
```

The robot saves the current end-effector pose.

This becomes the HOME pose.

---

## Step 2 — Create Waypoint

```cpp
Eigen::Vector3d translation(-0.07, 0.05, 0.15);
```

Defines an offset from HOME.

Waypoint is computed as:

```text
waypoint = home + offset
```

---

## Step 3 — Send Target

```cpp
eeTask_->set_ef_pose(waypointPose_);
```

The robot starts moving toward the waypoint.

---


Inside:

```cpp
manageStateMachine();
```

The controller checks:
- current state
- task error
- transitions

---

# State Machine

The controller has 3 states:

| State | Description |
|------|--------------|
| WAYPOINT | Move to waypoint |
| GO_HOME | Return to home pose |
| IDLE | Stop moving |

---

# State Flow

```text
RESET
  ↓
WAYPOINT
  ↓
GO_HOME
  ↓
IDLE
```

---


# Transition Condition

```cpp
if(error < 0.01)
```

If the error becomes small enough:
- target is considered reached
- state changes

---

# Example Motion

```text
Robot Start Pose
        ↓
Move to Offset Waypoint
        ↓
Return Home
        ↓
IDLE
```
